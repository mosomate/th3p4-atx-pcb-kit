This kit contains two PCBs. One is the **TH3P4-ATX-24P16S** (**24** pin **P**CB + **16** pin **S**traight connector). This turns the 24 pin connector on the motherboard 180 degrees backwards and reduces the number of wires between the PSU and the motherboard.

The other is the **TH3P4-ATX-8P8S** (**8** pin **P**CB + **8** pin **S**traight connector). This one only turns back 180 degress the connector as the previous one.
